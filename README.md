# Udacity FEND - Feed Reader Testing
In this project I used TDD (test-driven development) to add new features to a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## How To Run The Test Suites
* Download this repository
* Open the `index.html` file in your web browser  

## How To Check Spec Statuses
* Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the SpecRunner
* The SpecRunner lists all the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests running on the page and whether each of the tests pass or fail
